In 2021 the International Energy Agency (IEA) said that more efforts are needed to help limit climate change.[21] Some countries have highly developed their hydropower potential and have very little room for growth: Switzerland produces 88% of its potential and Mexico 80%.[22] In 2022, the IEA released a main-case forecast of 141 GW generated by hydropower over 2022–2027, which is slightly lower than deployment achieved from 2017–2022. Because environmental permitting and construction times are long, they estimate hydropower potential will remain limited, with only an additional 40 GW deemed possible in the accelerated case.[7]

Modernization of existing infrastructure
In 2021 the IEA said that major modernisation refurbishments are required.[2]: 67
